1 Gomoku:
  - file: gomoku.c
  - description: Gomoku game. Decide initial parameters (board size, search depth and how many x/o in a row is required to win) and challenge the machine.

2 Graph algorithms:
  - file: graph_algorithms.py
  - description: Create graphs and solve following algorithms: dijkstra, kruskal, ford-fulkerson.

3 Turing Machine:
  - main file: TuringMachine.py
  - description: Universal purpose Turing Machine. Implemented main task: compressing ipv6 adresses.

4 Rubik's cube solver:
  - main file: cube.py
  - description: Solves Rubik's cube given a mixed cube or given a scramble algorithm. Displays solution step by step using CFOP method. Can also generate a random scramble algorithm of given length using official rules. Uses official Rubik's cube notation.
  - additional file: cube_visualize.py
  - description: dispalys 2D or 3D representation of given cube using turtle. Meant to be developed into an application where one could use and visualize all the functions build in file cube.py.
